As you can see there are three main code files when you log in:

1. **forward-pass.ipynb** This is the code file for session 1: Understanding Neural Networks
2. **keras.ipynb** This is where all the code files for session 3: Understanding Tensorflow are kept
3. **imdb-reviews-classification.ipynb** This is the code file for session 4: Case Study: IMDB Movie review classification

The datasets required are linked in the code files itself. Please follow the steps that are shown in the video demonstration to install the data files.
OR 
You can download the data files from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hYw0TQbwcM2YWEiKN-2c_kHCPtHO_TMC)
